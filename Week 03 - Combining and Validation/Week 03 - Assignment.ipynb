    "Cannabis legalization and the COVID-19 pandemic represent two major disruptions that have impacted Colorado in the past decade. Data about both these disruptions is available at the county level and over time. This assignment is going to use your skills with concatenating and merging data to explore the relationships between four county-level datasets in Colorado.\n",

    "1. The [Marijuana Enforcement Division](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/enforcement/marijuanaenforcement) regulates Colorado's cannabis industry and publishes monthly county-level [sales reports](https://cdor.colorado.gov/data-and-reports/marijuana-data/marijuana-sales-reports).\n",
    "2. The State Demography Office publishes [county-level estimates](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/population/data/county-data-lookup/) of population, births, deaths, and housing at an annual frequency. \n",
